# Coupon App Prompt

Build me a coupon web app that I can deploy on Vercel.

It should do the following:

- Browse and search coupons by store, code, or description
- Filter by category (Electronics, Fashion, Food, General)
- Copy coupon codes to clipboard
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Vercel-ready deployment
